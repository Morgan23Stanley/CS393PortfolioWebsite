# CS393Project
 Greetings teacher,

 This is the start of my website. It is nowhere near done but it is the start of something beautiful. In order to see the actual website, you must first install quasar which is the framework I am using to make my website. 

 1. npm install quasar
 2. Ignore the setting up new project
 3. Open folder in VS Code
 4. Open up the terminal in VS Code
 5. Do cd '.\Hacker Website\' if you are not in the path already
 6. npx quasar dev
 7. When on the browser it should look like 'http://localhost:9000/#/home'

Here is a screenshot of what the website should look like when u do have it working:
